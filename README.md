Extract and reshape WFS data using R

This is work in progress developing an R package for extracting and reshaping World Fertility Survey (WFS) data
from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data archive. The WFS was a large demographic data collection
effort that conducted over forty surveys between 1972 and 1984. Its successor, the DHS program, has made available 
a large number of public-use data files, see [wfs.dhsprogram.com](http://wfs.dhsprogram.com) for more information.
