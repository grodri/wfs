Description: The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program, has made
  available online a large number of public-use files from its predecessor,
  the World Fertility Survey (WFS). This package facilitates use of these
  datasets by providing functions to view the documentation, make local
  copies of the files, extract data   directly from the data archive or 
  using local copies, and reshape the union and birth histories from wide 
  to long format and back.
